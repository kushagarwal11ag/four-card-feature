## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Applied the design nearly to perfection and made the website as responsive as possible without breaking any feature or losing text.
1. Learned how to specifically add border colors only on a part of element (Here, top of element).
2. Learned how to add box shadows.

```css
.supervisor {
	border-top: 5px solid hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
	box-shadow: 0 10px 5px hsla(229, 6%, 66%, 0.5);
}
```

### Useful resources
